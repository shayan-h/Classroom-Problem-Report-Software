# Classroom-Problem-Report-Software
Improving the University of Washington's classroom technology maintenance system by developing an algorithm to generate sets of classrooms. Each set is ranked on a scale of most to least frequently reported with an issue (various technical issues can be present in classrooms) while also taking into consideration the latest problem reports (how recently a particular classroom had a problem). This program is designed to reduce response time and optimize resources at UW.
